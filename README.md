Hello! I'm Max (she/they <- please use both). I'm a transplant from the world of theatre with a love of collaborative work and inclusivity. I'm currently working to complete certification from Coding Dojo. I have so far completed Python and Java Stacks. 

Fun fact: I'm an avid crafter and huge nerd. My friendship bracelets were featured in the finale episodes of Orphan Black on BBC America.
